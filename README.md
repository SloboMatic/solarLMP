According to the recent U.S. solar market reports [1], more than 1 GW of solar power has been added in each of the six consecutive quarters preceding 2015 mid-year mark. As a result, about 40% percent of total new electricity generation capacity in the first half of 2015 was coming from solar. The total capacity of residential roof-top solar power has more than doubled in the past 2.5 years. Thus, the power is increasingly being generated by the consumer and closer to the location of consumption. 

The electricity rate structure will play a determining role in the future growth of solar. Noticing the change in power generation and distribution, the regulator bodies in many states in U.S. will need to adopt a methodology to assess locational value of solar. See, for instance, recent developments in New York [2] and California [3]. 

This project will focus on the relationship between distributed solar generation and locational marginal price (LMP - the cost of supplying unit of power at a specific location). We will use the historical price data from the websites of regional system operators (e.g. [4] for CAISO in California). The National Renewable Energy Laboratory keeps an open access database of solar installation projects in U.S. [5] with published API [6]. We will create different solar growth scenarios and for each determine a fair LMP value. The analysis will be conducted at the level of zones defined by zipcode numbers.

For the challenge question we conducted a simple analysis on a rather small sample of available data. We considered electricity prices just for a single day and only for solar installations in California. In this effort a part of the challenge was matching each installation to the corresponding or closest available LMP zone. Namely, the zonal LMP data published by CAISO does not contain a location but only a cryptic code for each zone. Other web resources had to be used to perform the matching.

Figure 1 [7] shows distributions of solar installations and LMP prices across the state of California. The size of installed solar power (in kW) is denoted with the radius of red circles, whereas the price (in $/MWh) is denoted with the radius of blue circles. The green circles represent five largest cities in California. The figure shows that zones with higher LMP values are located along urban areas. Ignoring solar, this can be explained by the fact that in urban areas power transmission is more congested which demands higher electricity prices. However, figure also shows that the urban areas also have higher concentrations of solar installations. Since distributed installations reduce congestion, we might expect that this would have impact on LMP price reduction. 

To investigate this further we computed the distribution of installed solar power over the range of LMP values. This plot is shown in the upper portion of Figure 2 [8]. The dark green curve shows that zones with higher paying LMPs also produce more total solar power. In addition, as shown with the red curve in the bottom subplot, q-th percentile of highest LMP zones have approximately q-th percentile of total solar capacity. In conclusion, this exercise contributes to other analyses stating that so far solar installations had little effect on local electricity prices.
